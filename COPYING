The following statement from Agere clarifies the status of the firmware

---
I would like to confirm that the two drivers; Linux LKM Wireless Driver
Source Code, Version 7.18 and Linux LKM Wireless Driver Source Code,
Version 7.22 comply with Open Source BSD License. Therefore the source
code can be distributed in unmodified or modified form consistent with
the terms of the license.

The Linux driver architecture was based on two modules, the MSF (Module
specific functions) and the HCF (Hardware Control Functions).  Included
in the HCF is run-time firmware (binary format) which is downloaded into
the RAM of the Hermes 1/2/2.5 WMAC.

This hex coded firmware is not based on any open source software and
hence it is not subject to any Open Source License.  The firmware was
developed by Agere and runs on the DISC processor embedded within the
Hermes 1/2/2.5 Wireless MAC devices. 

Hope this helps.

Sincerely,

Viren Pathare
Intellectual Property Licensing Manager

Fast discrete Fourier and cosine transforms and inverses
author: Monty <xiphmont@mit.edu>
modifications by: Monty
last modification date: Jul 1 1996

/* These Fourier routines were originally based on the Fourier
routines of the same names from the NETLIB bihar and fftpack
fortran libraries developed by Paul N. Swarztrauber at the National
Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, CO USA.  They have been
reimplemented in C and optimized in a few ways for OggSquish. */

/* As the original fortran libraries are public domain, the C Fourier
routines in this file are hereby released to the public domain as
well.  The C routines here produce output exactly equivalent to the
original fortran routines.  Of particular interest are the facts

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


*** Please see the file RELEASE-NOTES for important last-minute updates ***


  0. OVERVIEW AND LICENSING/DISCLAIMER


This driver kit contains Linux drivers for the WIS GO7007SB multi-format
video encoder.  Only kernel version 2.6.x is supported.  The video stream
is available through the Video4Linux2 API and the audio stream is available
through the ALSA API (or the OSS emulation layer of the ALSA system).

The files in kernel/ and hotplug/ are licensed under the GNU General Public
License Version 2 from the Free Software Foundation.  A copy of the license
is included in the file COPYING.

The example applications in apps/ and C header files in include/ are
licensed under a permissive license included in the source files which
allows copying, modification and redistribution for any purpose without
attribution.

The firmware files included in the firmware/ directory may be freely
redistributed only in conjunction with this document; but modification,
tampering and reverse engineering are prohibited.

MICRONAS USA, INC., MAKES NO WARRANTIES TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY WITH
RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE OR ANY DERIVATIVES THEREOF OR ANY SERVICES OR
LICENSES AND DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SUPPORT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


  1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS


This driver requires Linux kernel 2.6.  Kernel 2.4 is not supported.  Using
kernel 2.6.10 or later is recommended, as earlier kernels are known to have
unstable USB 2.0 support.

A fully built kernel source tree must be available.  Typically this will be
linked from "/lib/modules/<KERNEL VERSION>/build" for convenience.  If this
link does not exist, an extra parameter will need to be passed to the
`make` command.

All vendor-built kernels should already be configured properly.  However,
for custom-built kernels, the following options need to be enabled in the
kernel as built-in or modules:

        CONFIG_HOTPLUG           - Support for hot-pluggable devices
        CONFIG_MODULES           - Enable loadable module support
        CONFIG_KMOD              - Automatic kernel module loading
        CONFIG_FW_LOADER         - Hotplug firmware loading support
        CONFIG_I2C               - I2C support
        CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV         - Video For Linux
        CONFIG_SOUND             - Sound card support
        CONFIG_SND               - Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
        CONFIG_USB               - Support for Host-side USB
        CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS      - USB device filesystem
        CONFIG_USB_EHCI_HCD      - EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support

Additionally, to use the example application, the following options need to
be enabled in the ALSA section:

        CONFIG_SND_MIXER_OSS     - OSS Mixer API
        CONFIG_SND_PCM_OSS       - OSS PCM (digital audio) API

The hotplug scripts, along with the fxload utility, must also be installed.
These scripts can be obtained from <http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/>.
Hotplugging is used for loading firmware into the Cypruss EZ-USB chip using
fxload and for loading firmware into the driver using the firmware agent.


  2. COMPILING AND INSTALLING THE DRIVER


Most users should be able to compile the driver by simply running:

        $ make

in the top-level directory of the driver kit.  First the kernel modules
will be built, followed by the example applications.

If the build system is unable to locate the kernel source tree for the
currently-running kernel, or if the module should be built for a kernel
other than the currently-running kernel, an additional parameter will need
to be passed to make to specify the appropriate kernel source directory:

        $ make KERNELSRC=/usr/src/linux-2.6.10-custom3

Once the compile completes, the driver and firmware files should be
installed by running:

        $ make install

The kernel modules will be placed in "/lib/modules/<KERNEL VERSION>/extra"
and the firmware files will be placed in the appropriate hotplug firmware
directory, usually /lib/firmware.  In addition, USB maps and scripts will
be placed in /etc/hotplug/usb to enable fxload to initialize the EZ-USB
control chip when the device is connected.


  3. PAL/SECAM TUNER CONFIGURATION (TV402U-EU only)


The PAL model of the Plextor ConvertX TV402U may require additional
configuration to correctly select the appropriate TV frequency band and
audio subchannel.

Users with a device other than the Plextor ConvertX TV402U-EU should skip
this section.

The wide variety of PAL TV systems used in Europe requires that additional
information about the local TV standards be passed to the driver in order
to properly tune TV channels.  The two necessary parameters are (a) the PAL
TV band, and (b) the audio subchannel format in use.

In many cases, the appropriate TV band selection is passed to the driver
from applications.  However, in some cases, the application only specifies
that the driver should use PAL but not the specific information about the
appropriate TV band.  To work around this issue, the correct TV band may be
specified in the "force_band" parameter to the wis-sony-tuner module:

     TV band           force_band
     -------           ----------
     PAL B/G                B
     PAL I                  I
     PAL D/K                D
     SECAM L                L

If the "force_band" parameter is specified, the driver will ignore any TV
band specified by applications and will always use the band provided in the
module parameter.

The other parameter that can be specified is the audio subchannel format.
There are several stereo audio carrier systems in use, including NICAM and
three varieties of A2.  To receive audio broadcast on one of these stereo
carriers, the "force_mpx_mode" parameter must be specified to the
wis-sony-tuner module.

     TV band           Audio subcarrier       force_mpx_mode
     -------           ----------------       --------------
     PAL B/G            Mono (default)               1
     PAL B/G                  A2                     2
     PAL B/G                 NICAM                   3

If the "force_mpx_mode" parameter is not specified, the correct mono-only
mode will be chosen based on the TV band.  However, the tuner will not
receive stereo audio or bilingual broadcasts correctly.

To pass the "force_band" or "force_mpx_mode" parameters to the
wis-sony-tuner module, the following line must be added to the modprobe
configuration file, which varies from one Linux distribution to another.

     options wis-sony-tuner force_band=B force_mpx_mode=2

The above example would force the tuner to the PAL B/G TV band and receive
stereo audio broadcasts on the A2 carrier.

To verify that the configuration has been placed in the correct location,
execute:

        $ modprobe -c | grep wis-sony-tuner

If the configuration line appears, then modprobe will pass the parameters
correctly the next time the wis-sony-tuner module is loaded into the
kernel.


  4. TESTING THE DRIVER


Because few Linux applications are able to correctly capture from
Video4Linux2 devices with only compressed formats supported, the new driver
should be tested with the "gorecord" application in the apps/ directory.

First connect a video source to the device, such as a DVD player or VCR.
This will be captured to a file for testing the driver.  If an input source
is unavailable, a test file can still be captured, but the video will be
black and the audio will be silent.

This application will auto-detect the V4L2 and ALSA/OSS device names of the
hardware and will record video and audio to an AVI file for a specified
number of seconds.  For example:

        $ apps/gorecord -duration 60 capture.avi

If this application does not successfully record an AVI file, the error
messages produced by gorecord and recorded in the system log (usually in
/var/log/messages) should provide information to help resolve the problem.

Supplying no parameters to gorecord will cause it to probe the available
devices and exit.  Use the -help flag for usage information.


  5. USING THE DRIVER


The V4L2 device implemented by the driver provides a standard compressed
format API, within the following criteria:

  * Applications that only support the original Video4Linux1 API will not
    be able to communicate with this driver at all.

  * No raw video modes are supported, so applications like xawtv that
    expect only uncompressed video will not function.

  * Supported compression formats are: Motion-JPEG, MPEG1, MPEG2 and MPEG4.

  * MPEG video formats are delivered as Video Elementary Streams only.
    Program Stream (PS), Transport Stream (TS) and Packetized Elementary
    Stream (PES) formats are not supported.

  * Video parameters such as format and input port may not be changed while
    the encoder is active.

  * The audio capture device only functions when the video encoder is
    actively capturing video.  Attempts to read from the audio device when
    the encoder is inactive will result in an I/O error.

  * The native format of the audio device is 48Khz 2-channel 16-bit
    little-endian PCM, delivered through the ALSA system.  No audio
    compression is implemented in the hardware.  ALSA may convert to other
    uncompressed formats on the fly.

The include/ directory contains a C header file describing non-standard
features of the GO7007SB encoder, which are described below:


  GO7007IOC_S_COMP_PARAMS, GO7007IOC_G_COMP_PARAMS

    These ioctls are used to negotiate general compression parameters.

    To query the current parameters, call the GO7007IOC_G_COMP_PARAMS ioctl
    with a pointer to a struct go7007_comp_params.  If the driver is not
    set to MPEG format, the EINVAL error code will be returned.

    To change the current parameters, initialize all fields of a struct
    go7007_comp_params and call the GO7007_IOC_S_COMP_PARAMS ioctl with a
    pointer to this structure.  The driver will return the current
    parameters with any necessary changes to conform to the limitations of
    the hardware or current compression mode.  Any or all fields can be set
    to zero to request a reasonable default value.  If the driver is not
    set to MPEG format, the EINVAL error code will be returned.  When I/O
    is in progress, the EBUSY error code will be returned.

    Fields in struct go7007_comp_params:

        __u32                        The maximum number of frames in each
          gop_size                   Group Of Pictures; i.e. the maximum
                                     number of frames minus one between
                                     each key frame.

        __u32                        The maximum number of sequential
          max_b_frames               bidirectionally-predicted frames.
                                     (B-frames are not yet supported.)

        enum go7007_aspect_ratio     The aspect ratio to be encoded in the
          aspect_ratio               meta-data of the compressed format.

                                     Choices are:
                                        GO7007_ASPECT_RATIO_1_1

                                        GO7007_ASPECT_RATIO_16_9_PAL

        __u32                        Bit-wise OR of control flags (below)
          flags

    Flags in struct go7007_comp_params:

        GO7007_COMP_CLOSED_GOP       Only produce self-contained GOPs, used
                                     to produce streams appropriate for
                                     random seeking.

        GO7007_COMP_OMIT_SEQ_HEADER  Omit the stream sequence header.


  GO7007IOC_S_MPEG_PARAMS, GO7007IOC_G_MPEG_PARAMS

    These ioctls are used to negotiate MPEG-specific stream parameters when
    the pixelformat has been set to V4L2_PIX_FMT_MPEG.

    To query the current parameters, call the GO7007IOC_G_MPEG_PARAMS ioctl
    with a pointer to a struct go7007_mpeg_params.  If the driver is not
    set to MPEG format, the EINVAL error code will be returned.

    To change the current parameters, initialize all fields of a struct
    go7007_mpeg_params and call the GO7007_IOC_S_MPEG_PARAMS ioctl with a
    pointer to this structure.  The driver will return the current
    parameters with any necessary changes to conform to the limitations of
    the hardware or selected MPEG mode.  Any or all fields can be set to
    zero to request a reasonable default value.  If the driver is not set
    to MPEG format, the EINVAL error code will be returned.  When I/O is in
    progress, the EBUSY error code will be returned.

    Fields in struct go7007_mpeg_params:

        enum go7007_mpeg_video_standard
          mpeg_video_standard        The MPEG video standard in which to
                                     compress the video.

                                     Choices are:
                                        GO7007_MPEG_VIDEO_MPEG1
                                        GO7007_MPEG_VIDEO_MPEG2
                                        GO7007_MPEG_VIDEO_MPEG4

        __u32                        Bit-wise OR of control flags (below)
          flags

        __u32                        The profile and level indication to be
          pali                       stored in the sequence header.  This
                                     is only used as an indicator to the
                                     decoder, and does not affect the MPEG
                                     features used in the video stream.
                                     Not valid for MPEG1.

                                     Choices for MPEG2 are:

                                        GO7007_MPEG4_PROFILE_AS_L5

    Flags in struct go7007_mpeg_params:

                                     with DVD MPEG2 stream requirements.
                                     This overrides most compression and

                                     the start of each GOP.


  GO7007IOC_S_BITRATE, GO7007IOC_G_BITRATE

    These ioctls are used to set and query the target bitrate value for the
    compressed video stream.  The bitrate may be selected by storing the
    target bits per second in an int and calling GO7007IOC_S_BITRATE with a
    pointer to the int.  The bitrate may be queried by calling
    GO7007IOC_G_BITRATE with a pointer to an int where the current bitrate
    will be stored.

    Note that this is the primary means of controlling the video quality
    for all compression modes, including V4L2_PIX_FMT_MJPEG.  The
    VIDIOC_S_JPEGCOMP ioctl is not supported.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Installing the WIS PCI Voyager Driver
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The WIS PCI Voyager driver requires several patches to the Linux 2.6.11.x
kernel source tree before compiling the driver.  These patches update the
in-kernel SAA7134 driver to the newest development version and patch bugs
in the TDA8290/TDA8275 tuner driver.

The following patches must be downloaded from Gerd Knorr's website and
applied in the order listed:

	http://dl.bytesex.org/patches/2.6.11-2/i2c-tuner
	http://dl.bytesex.org/patches/2.6.11-2/i2c-tuner2
	http://dl.bytesex.org/patches/2.6.11-2/v4l2-api-mpeg
	http://dl.bytesex.org/patches/2.6.11-2/saa7134-update

The following patches are included with this SDK and can be applied in any
order:

	patches/2.6.11/saa7134-voyager.diff
	patches/2.6.11/tda8275-newaddr.diff
	patches/2.6.11/tda8290-ntsc.diff

Check to make sure the CONFIG_VIDEO_SAA7134 option is enabled in the kernel
configuration, and build and install the kernel.

After rebooting into the new kernel, the GO7007 driver can be compiled and
installed:

	$ make SAA7134_BUILD=y
	$ make install
	$ modprobe saa7134-go7007

There will be two V4L video devices associated with the PCI Voyager.  The
first device (most likely /dev/video0) provides access to the raw video
capture mode of the SAA7133 device and is used to configure the source
video parameters and tune the TV tuner.  This device can be used with xawtv
or other V4L(2) video software as a standard uncompressed device.

The second device (most likely /dev/video1) provides access to the
compression functions of the GO7007.  It can be tested using the gorecord
application in the apps/ directory of this SDK:

	$ apps/gorecord -vdevice /dev/video1 -noaudio test.avi

Currently the frame resolution is fixed at 720x480 (NTSC) or 720x576 (PAL),
and the video standard must be specified to both the raw and the compressed
video devices (xawtv and gorecord, for example).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE NOTES FOR WIS GO7007SB LINUX DRIVER
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last updated: 5 November 2005

 - Release 0.9.7 includes new support for using udev to run fxload.  The
   install script should automatically detect whether the old hotplug
   scripts or the new udev rules should be used.  To force the use of
   hotplug, run "make install USE_UDEV=n".  To force the use of udev, run
   "make install USE_UDEV=y".

 - Motion detection is supported but undocumented.  Try the `modet` app
   for a demonstration of how to use the facility.

 - Using USB2.0 devices such as the TV402U with USB1.1 HCDs or hubs can
   cause buffer overruns and frame drops, even at low framerates, due to
   inconsistency in the bitrate control mechanism.

 - On devices with an SAA7115, including the Plextor ConvertX, video height
   values of 96, 128, 160, 192, 256, 320, and 384 do not work in NTSC mode.
   All valid heights up to 512 work correctly in PAL mode.

 - The WIS Star Trek and PCI Voyager boards have no support yet for audio
   or the TV tuner.

           License For Customer Use of NVIDIA Software


IMPORTANT NOTICE -- READ CAREFULLY: This License For Customer Use of
NVIDIA Software ("LICENSE") is the agreement which governs use of
the software of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries ("NVIDIA")
downloadable herefrom, including computer software and associated
printed materials ("SOFTWARE").  By downloading, installing, copying,
or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, you agree to be bound by the terms
of this LICENSE.  If you do not agree to the terms of this LICENSE,
do not download the SOFTWARE.

RECITALS

Use of NVIDIA's products requires three elements: the SOFTWARE, the
hardware, and a personal computer. The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright
laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual
property laws and treaties.  The SOFTWARE may be protected by various
patents, and is not sold, and instead is only licensed for use, strictly
in accordance with this document.  The hardware is protected by various
patents, and is sold, but this agreement does not cover that sale, since
it may not necessarily be sold as a package with the SOFTWARE.  This
agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of the SOFTWARE LICENSE only.

1.  DEFINITIONS

1.1  Customer.  Customer means the entity or individual that
downloads or otherwise obtains the SOFTWARE.

2.  GRANT OF LICENSE

2.1  Rights and Limitations of Grant.  NVIDIA hereby grants Customer
the following non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the
SOFTWARE, with the following limitations:

2.1.1  Rights.  Customer may install and use multiple copies of the
SOFTWARE on a shared computer or concurrently on different computers,
and make multiple back-up copies of the SOFTWARE, solely for Customer's
use within Customer's Enterprise. "Enterprise" shall mean individual use
by Customer or any legal entity (such as a corporation or university)
and the subsidiaries it owns by more than fifty percent (50%).

2.1.2  Open Source Exception.  Notwithstanding the foregoing terms
of Section 2.1.1, SOFTWARE may be copied and redistributed solely for
use on operating systems distributed under the terms of an OSI-approved
open source license as listed by the Open Source Initiative at
http://opensource.org, provided that the binary files thereof are not
modified, and Customer provides a copy of this license with the SOFTWARE.

2.1.3  Limitations.

No Reverse Engineering.  Customer may not reverse engineer,
decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE, nor attempt in any other
manner to obtain the source code.

Usage. SOFTWARE is licensed only for use with microprocessor(s) which have
been (i) designed by NVIDIA and (ii) either (a) sold by or (b) licensed by
NVIDIA. Customer shall not use SOFTWARE in conjunction with, nor cause
SOFTWARE to be executed by, any other microprocessor.

No Translation. Customer shall not translate SOFTWARE, nor cause or permit
SOFTWARE to be translated, from the architecture or language in which it is
originally provided by NVIDIA, into any other architecture or language.

No Rental.  Customer may not rent or lease the SOFTWARE to someone
else.

3.  TERMINATION

This LICENSE will automatically terminate if Customer fails to
comply with any of the terms and conditions hereof.  In such event,
Customer must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and all of its
component parts.

Defensive Suspension.  If Customer commences or participates in any legal
proceeding against NVIDIA, then NVIDIA may, in its sole discretion,
suspend or terminate all license grants and any other rights provided
under this LICENSE during the pendency of such legal proceedings.

4.  COPYRIGHT

All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE (including but
not limited to all images, photographs, animations, video, audio,
music, text, and other information incorporated into the SOFTWARE),
the accompanying printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE,
are owned by NVIDIA, or its suppliers.  The SOFTWARE is protected
by copyright laws and international treaty provisions.  Accordingly,
Customer is required to treat the SOFTWARE like any other copyrighted
material, except as otherwise allowed pursuant to this LICENSE
and that it may make one copy of the SOFTWARE solely for backup or
archive purposes.

5.  APPLICABLE LAW

This agreement shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall be
construed pursuant to, the laws of the State of California.

6.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION ON LIABILITY

6.1  No Warranties.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND NVIDIA AND ITS SUPPLIERS
DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

6.2  No Liability for Consequential Damages.  TO THE MAXIMUM
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL NVIDIA OR
ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS
OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT
OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF NVIDIA HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7.  MISCELLANEOUS

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed.  If any provision of this
LICENSE is inconsistent with, or cannot be fully enforced under,
the law, such provision will be construed as limited to the extent
necessary to be consistent with and fully enforceable under the law.
This agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement between
the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes
all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements relating
to such subject matter, whether oral or written.  Customer agrees
that it will not ship, transfer or export the SOFTWARE into any
country, or use the SOFTWARE in any manner, prohibited by the
United States Bureau of Export Administration or any export laws,
restrictions or regulations.  This LICENSE may only be modified in
writing signed by an authorized officer of NVIDIA.

the terms of this Agreement.   Any use, distribution or reproduction of this
CIRRUS LOGIC software constitutes your acceptance of the following terms and
conditions.

1.	DEFINED TERMS

âCIRRUS LOGICâ means either Cirrus Logic, Inc., a Delaware Corporation (for
licensees based in the United States), or Cirrus Logic International (UK) Ltd, a
company registered in Scotland (for licensees based outside the United States).

âLicenseeâ means the party which has accepted these terms, including by
distributing, reproducing and/or using the Software.
âSoftwareâ means software provided to Licensee in binary code form, that runs or
is intended to run on a processor embedded in an end product (and related files
and documentation) (âSoftwareâ).

2.	GRANT OF LICENSE

a.	Subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of this Agreement, CIRRUS
LOGIC grants to Licensee a non-exclusive , non-transferable license (the
âLicenseâ) to (i) use and integrate the Software  with other software, and (ii)
reproduce and distribute the Software in its complete and unmodified form,
provided all use of the Software is in connection with CIRRUS LOGIC
semiconductor devices. These license rights do not automatically extend to any
third-party software within the Software for which a separate license is
required to enable use by the Licensee.  Licensee must agree applicable license
terms with the relevant third-party licensors to use such software.
b.	Licensee (i) shall not remove or obscure any copyright and/or trademark
notices from the Software, and (ii) shall maintain and reproduce all copyright
and other proprietary notices on any copy in the same form and manner that such
notices are included on the Software (except if the Software is embedded such
that it is not readily accessible to an end user).
c.	Licensee may not make any modifications to the Software and may only
distribute the Software under the terms of this Agreement.  Recipients of the
Software must be provided with a copy of this Agreement.

3.	TERMINATION

a.	This Agreement will automatically terminate if Licensee does not comply with
its terms.
b.	In the event of termination:
i.	Licensee must destroy all copies of the Software (and parts thereof), and all
Proprietary Information (as defined below), including any original, backup, or
archival copy that Licensee may have installed, downloaded, or recorded on any
medium.  Upon written request from CIRRUS LOGIC, Licensee will certify in
writing that it has complied with this provision and has not retained any copies
of the Software or any Proprietary Information;
ii.	the rights and licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement will
immediately terminate;
iii.	all rights and obligations under this Agreement which by their nature
should survive termination, will remain in full force and effect.

4.	OWNERSHIP, RIGHTS, USE LIMITATIONS, AND DUTIES

a.	CIRRUS LOGIC and/or its licensors own all proprietary rights in the Software.
 Whilst this Agreement is in effect,  Licensee hereby covenants that it will not
assert any claim that the Software infringes any intellectual property rights
owned or controlled by Licensee.

grant, and Licensee does not receive, any ownership right, title or interest in
any intellectual property rights relating to the Software, nor in any copy of
any part of the foregoing.  No license is granted to Licensee in any human
readable code of the Software (source code).
c.	Licensee shall not (i) use, license, sell or otherwise distribute the
Software except as provided in this Agreement, (ii) attempt to modify in any
way, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any portion of the Software; or

which CIRRUS LOGIC semiconductor devices are not designed, tested or intended,
as detailed in the CIRRUS LOGIC Terms and Conditions of Sale, available at
www.cirrus.com/legal (as the same may be updated from time to time), which shall
apply to Licenseeâs use of Software, insofar as relevant thereto.
e.	CIRRUS LOGIC may require Licensee to cease using a version of the Software,
and may require use of an updated version, where (a) a third-party has claimed
that the Software infringes its intellectual property rights, and/or (b) for
technical reasons CIRRUS LOGIC is no longer able to permit ongoing use of the
version of the Software being used by Licensee.
f.	If Licensee requests support, CIRRUS LOGIC has no obligation to provide any
such support but if it agrees to do so any such support will be on a reasonable
efforts basis.
g.	Licensee shall keep complete and accurate records of its use of the Software
and shall, on request, promptly provide to CIRRUS LOGIC a certificate evidencing
the extent of such use.

5.	CONFIDENTIALITY

a.	Licensee may obtain or be provided with information relating to the Software,
including in documentation provided to it (âProprietary Informationâ).  Such
Proprietary Information shall belong solely to CIRRUS LOGIC and/or its
affiliates (or, as the case may be, relevant third parties).
b.	During and after the term of this Agreement, Licensee agrees  to maintain all
such Proprietary Information in strict confidence and to not use (except as
expressly authorized in this Agreement), disclose, or provide any third-party
with access to any Proprietary Information except under a written agreement with
terms at least as protective as the terms of this Agreement.  Licensee also
agrees to exercise the same degree of care and diligence as it uses in respect
of its own confidential and proprietary information when dealing with CIRRUS
LOGIC Proprietary Information, and in any event no less than reasonable care and
diligence.
c.	Information will not be considered Proprietary Information if (i) it becomes
public knowledge other than through any act or omission constituting a breach of
the Licenseeâs obligations under this Agreement; (ii) the Licensee can prove it
was already in the Licenseeâs possession and at its free disposal before the
disclosure hereunder; and (iii) it was received in good faith from a third party
having no obligation of confidentiality and which is free to disclose such
Confidential Information

6.	NO WARRANTIES OR LIABILITIES

LICENSEE EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY
CIRRUS LOGIC âAS ISâ WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER AND THAT THE
INSTALLATION, OPERATION AND USE OF THE SOFTWARE IS AT LICENSEEâS OWN RISK.
CIRRUS LOGIC MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, AND EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, GOOD TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR PERFORMANCE OR
WHICH MAY ARISE FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE OR TRADE PRACTICE.  CIRRUS LOGIC
PROVIDES NO WARRANTY THAT THE SOFTWARE IS FREE FROM DEFECTS OR CHARACTERISTICS
THAT COULD CAUSE VULNERABILITY TO CYBER-ATTACK, DATA BREACH OR PRIVACY
VIOLATIONS. CIRRUS LOGIC SHALL IN NO EVENT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANYONE ELSE
FOR ANY LOSS, INJURY OR DAMAGE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR PART BY THE INSTALLATION,
OPERATION OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, LICENSEEâS INCORRECT USE OF THE SOFTWARE
INCLUDING ANY FAILURE TO PROPERLY INSTALL ANY UPDATES TO THE SOFTWARE OR OTHER
SOFTWARE WITH WHICH THE SOFTWARE OPERATES OR WHICH IT UPDATES, OR IS INTENDED TO
OPERATE WITH OR UPDATE, OR THE RESULTS PRODUCED BY, OR FAILURES, DELAYS, OR
INTERRUPTIONS OF THE SOFTWARE.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING GENERALITY,
CIRRUS LOGIC SHALL IN NO EVENT BE LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS WHICH ARISE FROM, OR IN ANY WAY RELATE TO, USE OF
THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY CLAIMS RELATING TO HAPTICS ON A
COMPONENT OR SYSTEM LEVEL.  CIRRUS LOGIC AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL IN NO EVENT BE
LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
SPECIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOST PROFITS ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THE INSTALLATION, OPERATION OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE.    BECAUSE SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR
TYPES OF CLAIM OR LOSS THEN IN SUCH INSTANCES THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED TO APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LOCAL LAW.  SUBJECT TO THE
FOREGOING, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF CIRRUS LOGIC AND ITS LICENSORS TO LICENSEE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, AND/OR ARISING FROM, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE USE OF (OR
INABILITY TO USE) THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), QUASI TORT, OR OTHERWISE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE LICENSE FEES (IF ANY)
PAID BY LICENSEE FOR THE SOFTWARE THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM, OR TEN THOUSAND
U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $10,000), WHICHEVER IS GREATER.

7.	EXPORT AND END USE RESTRICTIONS

Licensee acknowledges that the Software is subject to United States and other
applicable export related laws and  regulations (âExport Lawsâ).  Licensee
agrees that it may not export, re-export or transfer the Software or any direct
product of the Software other than in accordance with those Export Laws.
Licensee further agrees to be bound by, and to act in accordance with,
provisions of the CIRRUS LOGIC Terms and Conditions of Sale available at
www.cirrus.com/legal (as updated from time to time), including insofar as they
relate to export/end use restrictions.

8.	GENERAL PROVISIONS

This Agreement is not assignable or sub-licensable by Licensee without the prior
written consent of CIRRUS LOGIC.  CIRRUS LOGIC may sub-license or assign any or
all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without Licenseeâs
consent.  The waiver by either party of a breach of this Agreement shall not
constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach of this Agreement; nor shall any
delay to exercise any right under this Agreement operate as a waiver of such
right.  This Agreement shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall be
construed pursuant to the laws of, the State of Texas without regard to
conflicts of laws provisions thereof.  Both parties hereby consent to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the State of Texas and the locale of Austin therein.
The prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled
to recover costs and expenses including, without limitation, attorneys' fees.
The parties agree that  CIRRUS LOGIC and its licensors shall be entitled to
equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law.

9.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT

This Agreement and any terms referenced or incorporated herein, constitutes the
entire agreement between Licensee and CIRRUS LOGIC with respect to the Software
provided pursuant to this Agreement and supersedes any other agreement between
Licensee and CIRRUS LOGIC with respect thereto (including terms presented and/or
accepted as part of an installation process), but does not otherwise replace,
modify or cancel any other written agreement between Licensee and CIRRUS LOGIC.
If there is any inconsistency between these terms and those presented as part of
the process to install the Software, these terms will prevail.

PLEASE READ THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT") CAREFULLY.  THIS AGREEMENT IS
A BINDING LEGAL AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BY AND BETWEEN YOU (OR IF YOU ARE
ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY, THEN THE ENTITY THAT YOU
REPRESENT) AND QUALCOMM TECHNOLOGIES, INC. ("QTI" "WE" "OUR" OR "US").  THIS IS
THE AGREEMENT THAT APPLIES TO YOUR USE OF THE DESIGNATED AND/OR LINKED
APPLICATIONS, THE ENCLOSED QUALCOMM TECHNOLOGIES' MATERIALS, INCLUDING RELATED
DOCUMENTATION AND ANY UPDATES OR IMPROVEMENTS THEREOF
(COLLECTIVELY, "MATERIALS").  BY USING OR COMPLETING THE INSTALLATION OF THE
MATERIALS, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT AND YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS
TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, QTI IS UNWILLING TO
AND DOES NOT LICENSE THE MATERIALS TO YOU. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS
YOU MUST DISCONTINUE THE INSTALLATION PROCESS AND YOU MAY NOT USE THE MATERIALS
OR RETAIN ANY COPIES OF THE MATERIALS. ANY USE OR POSSESSION OF THE MATERIALS
BY YOU IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.

1. RIGHT TO USE DELIVERABLES; RESTRICTIONS.

  1.1 License.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
  including, without limitation, the restrictions, conditions, limitations and
  exclusions set forth in this Agreement, QTI hereby grants to you a
  nonexclusive, limited license under QTI's copyrights to:  (i) install and use
  the Materials; and (ii) to reproduce and redistribute the binary code portions
  of the Materials (the "Redistributable Binary Code").  You may make and use a
  reasonable number of copies of any documentation.

  1.2 Redistribution Restrictions.  Distribution of the Redistributable Binary
  Code is subject to the following restrictions: (i) Redistributable Binary Code
  may only be distributed in binary format and may not be distributed in source
  code format:; (ii)  the Redistributable Binary Code may only operate in
  conjunction with platforms incorporating Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. chipsets;

  file setting forth the terms and condition of this Agreement; (iv) you may not
  use Qualcomm Technologies' or its affiliates or subsidiaries name, logo or
  trademarks; and (v) copyright, trademark, patent and any other notices that

  1.3 Additional Restrictions.  Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement,
  you shall have no right to sublicense, transfer or otherwise disclose the
  Materials to any third party.  You shall not reverse engineer, reverse
  assemble, reverse translate, decompile or reduce to source code form any
  portion of the Materials provided in object code form or executable form.
  Except for the purposes expressly permitted in this Agreement, You shall not
  use the Materials for any other purpose.  QTI (or its licensors) shall retain
  title and all ownership rights in and to the Materials and any alterations,
  modifications (including all derivative works), translations or adaptations
  made of the Materials, and all copies thereof, and nothing herein shall be
  deemed to grant any right to You under any of QTI's or its affiliates'
  patents.  You shall not subject the Materials to any third party license
  terms (e.g., open source license terms).  You shall not use the Materials for
  the purpose of identifying or providing evidence to support any potential
  patent infringement claim against QTI, its affiliates, or any of QTI's or
  QTI's affiliates' suppliers and/or direct or indirect customers.  QTI hereby
  reserves all rights not expressly granted herein.

  1.4 Third Party Software and Materials.  The Software may contain or link to
  certain software and/or materials that are written or owned by third parties.
  Such third party code and materials may be licensed under separate or
  different terms and conditions and are not licensed to you under the terms of
  this Agreement.  You agree to comply with all terms and conditions imposed on
  you in the applicable third party licenses.  Such terms and conditions may
  impose certain obligations on you as a condition to the permitted use of such
  third party code and materials.  QTI does not represent or warrant that such
  third party licensors have or will continue to license or make available their
  code and materials to you.

  1.5 Feedback.  QTI may from time to time receive suggestions, feedback or
  other information from You regarding the Materials.  Any suggestions, feedback
  or other disclosures received from You are and shall be entirely voluntary on
  the part of You.  Notwithstanding any other term in this Agreement, QTI shall
  be free to use suggestions, feedback or other information received from You,
  without obligation of any kind to You.  The Parties agree that all inventions,
  product improvements, and modifications conceived of or made by QTI that are
  based, either in whole or in part, on ideas, feedback, suggestions, or
  recommended improvements received from You are the exclusive property of QTI,
  and all right, title and interest in and to any such inventions, product
  improvements, and modifications will vest solely in QTI.

  1.6 No Technical Support.  QTI is under no obligation to provide any form of
  technical support for the Materials, and if QTI, in its sole discretion,
  chooses to provide any form of support or information relating to the
  Materials, such support and information shall be deemed confidential and
  proprietary to QTI.

IMPLIED.  QTI ITS LICENSORS AND AFFILIATES MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE MATERIALS OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION OR DOCUMENTATION

MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, OR
ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF TRADE USAGE OR OUT OF A COURSE OF
DEALING OR COURSE OF PERFORMANCE.  NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE

AFFILIATES AS TO THE VALIDITY OR SCOPE OF ANY PATENT, COPYRIGHT OR OTHER
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT OR (II) A WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION BY QTI THAT ANY
MANUFACTURE OR USE WILL BE FREE FROM INFRINGEMENT OF PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS OR
OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS, AND IT SHALL BE THE SOLE
RESPONSIBILITY OF YOU TO MAKE SUCH DETERMINATION AS IS NECESSARY WITH RESPECT TO
THE ACQUISITION OF LICENSES UNDER PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF
THIRD PARTIES.

3. NO OTHER LICENSES OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. Neither this Agreement,
nor any act by QTI or any of its affiliates pursuant to this Agreement or
relating to the Materials (including, without limitation, the provision by QTI
or its affiliates of the Materials), shall provide to You any license or any
other rights whatsoever under any patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights
or any other intellectual property of QTI or any of its affiliates, except for
the copyright rights expressly licensed under this Agreement. You understand and
agree that:

  (i) Neither this Agreement, nor delivery of the Materials, grants any right to
  practice, or any other right at all with respect to, any patent of QTI or any
  of its affiliates; and

  (ii) A separate license agreement from QUALCOMM Incorporated is needed to use
  or practice any patent of QUALCOMM Incorporated. You agree not to contend in
  any context that, as a result of the provision or use of the Materials, either
  QTI or any of its affiliates has any obligation to extend, or You or any other
  party has obtained any right to, any license, whether express or implied, with
  respect to any patent of QTI or any of its affiliates for any purpose.

4. TERMINATION.  This Agreement shall be effective upon acceptance, or access or
use of the Materials (whichever occurs first) by You and shall continue until
terminated. You may terminate the Agreement at any time by deleting and
destroying all copies of the Materials and all related information in Your
possession or control. This Agreement terminates immediately and automatically,
with or without notice, if You fail to comply with any provision hereof.
Additionally, QTI may at any time terminate this Agreement, without cause, upon
notice to You. Upon termination You must, to the extent possible, delete or
destroy all copies of the Materials in Your possession and the license granted
to You in this Agreement shall terminate. Sections 1.2 through 10 shall survive
the termination of this Agreement. In the event that any restrictions,
conditions, limitations are found to be either invalid or unenforceable, the
rights granted to You in Section 1 (License) shall be null, void and ineffective
from the Effective Date, and QTI shall also have the right to terminate this
Agreement immediately, and with retroactive effect to the effective date.

5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT SHALL QTI, QTI's AFFILIATES OR ITS
LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, OR OTHER INCIDENTAL
DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE, OR THE DELIVERY OR FAILURE
TO DELIVER, ANY OF THE DELIVERABLES, OR ANY BREACH OF ANY OBLIGATION UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT, EVEN IF QTI HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOUR REMEDIES HEREUNDER ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE FAILED OF
THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF QTI, QTI's AFFILIATES AND ITS
LICENSORS, AND THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF YOU, FOR ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF
ACTION ARISING HEREUNDER (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL NOT
EXCEED US$50.

6. INDEMNIFICATION.  You agree to indemnify and hold harmless QTI and its
officers, directors, employees and successors and assigns against any and all
third party claims, demands, causes of action, losses, liabilities, damages,
costs and expenses, incurred by QTI (including but not limited to costs of
defense, investigation and reasonable attorney's fees) arising out of, resulting
from or related to: (i) any breach of this Agreement by You; and (ii) your acts,
omissions, products and services.  If requested by QTI, You agree to defend QTI
in connection with any third party claims, demands, or causes of action
resulting from, arising out of or in connection with any of the foregoing.

7. ASSIGNMENT.  You shall not assign this Agreement or any right or interest
under this Agreement, nor delegate any obligation to be performed under this
Agreement, without QTI's prior written consent.  For purposes of this Section 7,
an "assignment" by You under this Section shall be deemed to include, without
limitation, any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of its
assets, or any substantial change in the management or control of You.
Any attempted assignment in contravention of this Section 9 shall be void.
QTI may freely assign this Agreement or delegate any or all of its rights and
obligations hereunder to any third party.

8. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS; APPLICABLE LAW.  You agree to comply with all
applicable local, international and national laws and regulations and with U.S.
Export Administration Regulations, as they apply to the subject matter of this
Agreement.  This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California,
excluding California's choice of law rules.

9. CONTRACTING PARTIES.  If the Materials are downloaded on any computer owned
by a corporation or other legal entity, then this Agreement is formed by and
between QTI and such entity.  The individual accepting the terms of this
Agreement represents and warrants to QTI that they have the authority to bind
such entity to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

10. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.  This Agreement, together with all exhibits
attached hereto, which are incorporated herein by this reference, constitutes
the entire agreement between QTI and You and supersedes all prior negotiations,
representations and agreements between the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof.  No addition or modification of this Agreement shall be effective
unless made in writing and signed by the respective representatives of QTI and
You.  The restrictions, limitations, exclusions and conditions set forth in this
Agreement shall apply even if QTI or any of its affiliates becomes aware of or
fails to act in a manner to address any violation or failure to comply
therewith.  You hereby acknowledge and agree that the restrictions, limitations,
conditions and exclusions imposed in this Agreement on the rights granted in
this Agreement are not a derogation of the benefits of such rights.  You further
acknowledges that, in the absence of such restrictions, limitations, conditions
and exclusions, QTI would not have entered into this Agreement with You.  Each
party shall be responsible for and shall bear its own expenses in connection
with this Agreement.  If any of the provisions of this Agreement are determined
to be invalid, illegal, or otherwise unenforceable, the remaining provisions
shall remain in full force and effect.  This Agreement is entered into solely
in the English language, and if for any reason any other language version is
prepared by any party, it shall be solely for convenience and the English
version shall govern and control all aspects.  If You are located in the
province of Quebec, Canada, the following applies: The Parties hereby confirm
they have requested this Agreement and all related documents be prepared
in English.
